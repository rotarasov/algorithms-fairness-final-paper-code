# Geopolitical biases in LLMs: The Russia-Ukraine war case

This repo contains source code for my research paper for Algorithms & Fairness course, where I investigated to what extent modern LLMs are biased against politcally-sensitive topics like the Russia-Ukraine war. 

I investigate two LLMs: OpenAI's ChatGPT 4o and DeepSeek's DeepSeek-V3-0324. Both are general-purpose models provided in the free tiers of their respective web interafces - the place where most users encounter and experience potential biases.

If interested, please take a look at `questions.json` and then at `plots` and `outputs` folders where I provide results of my analysis. Later I might publish a research paper here as well.

Below find a list of references that inspired me for this research.
